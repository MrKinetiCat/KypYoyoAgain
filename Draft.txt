Projectile give debuff https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/how-do-you-make-a-projectile-apply-a-debuff-onto-a-hit-enemy.87591/


Main mechanics:

    Create your own yoyos! Craft existing vanilla weapons into new yoyos!
    Using the shimmer will revert the yoyo back into it's crafting components.
    Go crazy go stupid.



Starfury as yoyo



Ideas for accessories

    Name [progression] (recipe) {use} <ingamedescription>
    Bag of Counterweights [Prehardmode] (1 of each counterweight) {Throws out six counterweights upon single hit} <Creates chaos by throwing six counterweights upon single hit by yoyo.>
    Reinforced string [post evil boss] (10 meteor bars + one string) {Increases throw distance by 6 blocks instead of 4-5} <Throws yoyos just a little bit further than normal string>
    Bag of Holding of Counterweights [post skeletron] (void bag + bag of counterweights) {Throws six counterweights upon single hit and one more for every hit until yoyo retracts or until 12 counterweights} <Creates chaos through counterweight spam.>
    Robotic Arm [post skeletron prime] (100% Dropped from Skeletron prime loot bag) {Allows you to throw another yoyo} <Throws another yoyo, regardless of if the first hits or not.>
    Counterweight Pocket Dimension [post pillars] (Bag of Holding of Counterweights + 20 void fragments) {creates phantasmal counterweights from thin air and spews them out in a random direction at a rate of one every 0.125s that are NOT attached to the player by string and will bounce 3 times with no gravity effect (use crystal storm projectile to use as framework for creating a new projectile)} <These counterweights aren't long for this world, but they won't leave without a fight.>



Ideas for yoyos


Prehardmode

    Learned Yoyo [prehardmode] (15 books + string) {equivalent to malaise yoyo in damage (17d) + range, has a small (10') damaging (3dps no knockback) aura around it} <Despite your crude and brutish crafting, it somehow gained a damaging aura.>
    Paper Yoyo [post evil boss] (10 paper airplanes + 20 meteor bars) {+20 armor penetration (25d)} <Ouch! A paper cut!>
    Sunfury Yoyo [post skeletron] (Sunfury + string) {Like cascade but a little worse (26d), fire debuff lasts shorter than cascade} <Like a hand warmer but in yoyo form> 
    Blue Moon Yoyo [post skeletron] (Blue Moon + string) {Like hi-five but a little bit better (27d)} <Feels cool to the touch>
    Sun and Moon [post skeletron] (blue moon flail > blue moon yoyo + sunfury > sunfury yoyo + two string) {throws out two yoyos, one blue one red, red inflicts on fire debuff, blue creates light particles. The only yoyo prehardmode that throws out two yoyos (30d each)} <Finally, the sun and moon come together in a harmonious dance...just...ignore the vacancy of Terra.>
    True Learned Yoyo [post skeletron] (learned yoyo + all prehardmode books (3 of them)) {fires a projectile (skull, demon scythe, or waterbolt) for in a spread (25 degrees where cursor is) every 1.4 seconds (24d))} <Not your best craftsmanship, but it will do.>


Hardmode

    Smelted Scrap Yoyo [early hardmode] (musket + boomstick + handgun + quad barrel shotgun + star cannon + minishark) {Literally nothing but bleeding debuff (35d)} <It's pretty rough around the edges, so be careful.>
    Decorated True Learned Yoyo [early hardmode] (True learned yoyo + flower of frost + flower of fire) {fires a random projectile (demon scythe, waterbolt, skull, ball of fire, ball of frost) in a tighter spread (20 degrees) every 1.1 seconds (45d) <Looks like trash, smells like heaven.>
    Mega Super Uber Amazing Yoyo [post destroyer] (Smelted Scrap yoyo + 12 hallowed bars + 5 shark fins + 20 souls of might + illegal gun parts) {Bleeding, 60d, creates a debuff called "Despised" where it's +400 aggro, lasts as long as it's used+10 seconds when retracted (look at invisibility potion for help maybe? [-700 when not using item, -250 when using any item])} <You have created an abomination to Terraria. When used, enemies are more likely to target you.>


Post mech pre pillars

    Wise Decorated True Learned Yoyo [post mech] (Decorated true learned yoyo + crystal storm + golden shower + cursed flames + tome of infinite wisdom) {fires a random projectile (demon scythe, waterbolt, skull, ball of fire, ball of frost, tome of infinite wisdom, cursed flame (friendly), golden shower (friendly), crystal storm) in a tighter spread (15 degrees) every 0.8 seconds (55d)(15% crit)) <With a name like this, it's gotta be good.>
    Terra Yoyo [post mech] (Terra Blade + reinforced string) {Green, like the terra blade, creates projectiles that move in the direction of the cursor ahead of the yoyo, (65d) (creates a new projectile every 0.35s, lasts for 150 blocks, pierces infinitely) <Terra blade, but in yoyo form, what more could you ask for?>
    Orrery Yoyo [post mech] (terra yoyo + "sun + moon") {All three yoyos in harmony, sun in center, terra around sun, moon around terra (72d) terra still shoots out projectiles, but sun + moon don't, sun inflicts on fire debuff} <Behold! Our star system, but in yoyo form!>
    Scholar's Sidekick [post fishron] (Wise Decorated True learned yoyo + magnet sphere + razorblade typhoon) {fires a random projectile (demon scythe, waterbolt, skull, ball of fire, ball of frost, tome of infinite wisdom, cursed flame (friendly), golden shower (friendly), crystal storm, magnet sphere ball+magnet sphere bolt, typhoon) in a tight spread (10 degrees) every 0.5 seconds. (100d)} <The penultimate in the learned yoyo series, use it well Terrarian.>


Post pillars beyond

    True Orrery Yoyo [post pillars] (Orrery yoyo + 10 each lunar fragments [from pillars]) {literally nothing changes but 5 to 10% crit chance and now 130d} <Now 50% more chaos!>
    Scholar's Passion Project [post moonlord] (Scholar's sidekick + Lunar flare) {fires a random projectile (demon scythe, waterbolt, skull, ball of fire, ball of frost, tome of infinite wisdom, cursed flame (friendly), golden shower (friendly), crystal storm, magnet sphere ball+magnet sphere bolt, typhoon, lunar flare) every 0.25 seconds (200d)
    Ultimatum [post moonlord] (True Orrery Yoyo + Scholar's Passion Project + 



Ideas for other

    Counterweight Grenade [prehardmode] (one counterweight of any kind + 100 bombs = 100 counterweight grenades) {throws counterweights as shrapnel, make a counterweight projectile, not affected by gravity (50d)} <Throws counterweights as shrapnel> 
    Yoyo sentry [post golem] (golem drop?) {throws a buffed version of the sun and moon yoyo (85d)} <Finally, something to throw your yoyos for you!>
